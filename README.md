WP Galleria Display
===================

Simple WordPress plugin to add Galleria Display galleries to posts.

##How to use
After installing, you will get a new icon in your toolbar:
![Galleria Display Logo](i/gd-logo.png?raw=true)

Clicking it will open a dialog. Simply paste your gallery id (or the whole script tag from Galleria Display) och press OK, and the necessary shortcode will be generated for you. Publish.

##Installing
For now, download and unzip to your wp-content/plugins/ folder

##Compability
Tested in WordPress 3.9, which uses TinyMCE 4.x. Will probably not work in earlier versions, due to API changes in TinyMCE.
